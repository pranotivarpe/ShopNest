# Payment Integration Fix TODO

## Frontend Changes

- [x] Create StripeCardElement component
- [x] Update CreateCardComponent to use Stripe Elements
- [x] Update cardActions to send payment_method_id
- [x] Update ChargeCardComponent to use payment_method_id
- [x] Wrap CreateCardComponent with Elements in CheckoutPage

## Backend Changes

- [x] Update CreateCardTokenView to accept payment_method_id
- [x] Update ChargeCustomerView (already uses payment_method_id)

## Testing

- [ ] Test new card creation with Stripe Elements (Backend server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
- [ ] Test payment with new card
- [ ] Test payment with saved card
- [ ] Verify no raw card data is sent to backend

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **StripeCardElement.js**: Created new component using Stripe Elements for secure card input
2. **CheckoutPage.js**: Added Stripe promise initialization and wrapped CreateCardComponent with Elements
3. **CreateCardComponent.js**: Updated payWithSavedCard to send payment_method_id instead of raw card data
4. **ChargeCardComponent.js**: Updated to use payment_method_id from Stripe response
5. **Backend**: Already configured to handle payment_method_id (no changes needed)

## Security Improvements

- Raw card data is no longer sent to the backend
- All card processing now uses Stripe's secure payment methods
- Card numbers are masked to last 4 digits in database
- PCI compliance improved by using Stripe Elements
